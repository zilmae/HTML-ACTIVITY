<p> The legend of the Tiyanak is a famous and frightening tale in Philippine folklore, often shared across generations to explain mysterious dangers in forests and remote areas. The Tiyanak is believed to be a supernatural creature that disguises itself as a helpless, crying baby to lure kind-hearted travelers. Drawn by the sound of an infant in distress, people approach to offer help, unaware that the cries are a trap. Once the victim is close enough, the Tiyanak reveals its true form—a monstrous being with sharp teeth, claws, and immense strength—attacking or frightening the person who was deceived.

Stories about the Tiyanak vary from region to region. In some versions, it is said to be the spirit of an unbaptized child or an abandoned infant that turned into a vengeful creature. Other versions describe it as a shapeshifting monster that feeds on fear rather than flesh. The Tiyanak is often associated with dark, secluded places such as forests, mountains, and ravines, reinforcing the idea that danger lurks in unfamiliar environments. Despite its terrifying nature, the legend also serves an important moral purpose: it warns people not to blindly trust what they see or hear and reminds children to stay close to home and avoid wandering alone at night. Through this legend, Filipino culture highlights the values of caution, wisdom, and respect for the unknown.
