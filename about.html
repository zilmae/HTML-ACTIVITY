        <h1>Origin of the Tiyanak</h1>
        <p>
           The myth of the Tiyanak originated in Philippine folklore as a warning about the dangers found in forests, rivers, and remote areas. Long ago, these places were poorly lit and unsafe, and stories like the Tiyanak helped explain mysterious disappearances and strange sounds at night. Some versions describe the Tiyanak as the spirit of an abandoned or unborn child, while others portray it as a shape-shifting creature that uses a baby’s cry to deceive people. The legend was passed down orally to teach caution, especially to children and travelers. Through this myth, early Filipinos used fear and storytelling to protect their communities and reinforce moral lessons about awareness and obedience.

        <h1>My Reflection</h1>
        <p>
            Personally, the story of the Tiyanak made me reflect on how fear can be used to teach important lessons. It reminded me that while helping others is important, we should also be careful and think before acting. The legend shows the value of listening to elders because their stories often come from real dangers they once faced. I also realized that folklore connects people to their culture and history in a meaningful way. Even in modern times, the lesson of being cautious in unfamiliar places still applies. Overall, the Tiyanak myth helped me appreciate how stories can guide behavior and shape values.
