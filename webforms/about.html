<h1>What can you see in my Webforms Page?</h1>
<p>In this project, I created a variety of forms using HTML to showcase how different input types and structures can improve user interaction on a website. I explored essential form elements such as text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdown menus, and text areas, and combined them with labels and proper formatting to ensure clarity and ease of use. I also applied basic attributes, organized sections for rforms such as registrations, feedback, and surveys. Through this process, I improved my understanding of HTML and learned how effective form design can enhance the overall functionality and user experience of a webpage.</p>
