<p>One stormy evening, a young man traveling home heard the familiar cry while crossing a lonely forest path. The rain poured heavily, and the sound of thunder filled the sky, but the baby’s crying cut through the noise like a sharp blade. Driven by pity and courage, he followed the sound, pushing past thorny bushes and slippery roots. At last, he saw a small baby lying alone near a fallen tree, its face hidden and its cries growing weaker. As he reached out to help, the forest suddenly fell silent, and an unnatural chill crept into the air.
<br>
In an instant, the baby twisted and changed, its innocent form turning into the terrifying Tiyanak. Its eyes glowed fiercely, its mouth opened wide to reveal sharp fangs, and its laughter echoed cruelly through the trees. The creature leapt toward the young man, delighting in his fear. Panicking, he ran as fast as he could, tripping over roots and branches while the Tiyanak chased him through the forest. With his last strength, he escaped the woods and collapsed at the edge of the village, where he warned everyone of the horror he had seen.
